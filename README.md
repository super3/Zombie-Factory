About
-------
Thanks for taking a look at the Zombie Factory Project. The Zombie Factory is a simple
zombie shooter developed with PyGame (http://pygame.org) and Python (http://python.org).
I created it to test the functionatly of PyGame, to play around with Python a bit, and 
learn a bit of pixel art in the process. 

Progress
-------
Currently I am developing some base and flexible classes. These classes are better explained
in their docstrings. These all form a loose game engine on which the game will be built, and
also can be used in the future. 

While some of these classes might be pretty specific, like the civilian class, others could be
very helpful for general PyGame development. For example, the world class is able to load in a
space with a background image, music, icon, title, and is also scrollable. Just add some of 
your sprites, and it is ready to go. So if you are looking for something for your project I
would start there.
