About
-------
Thanks for taking a look at the Zombie Factory Project. The Zombie Factory is a simple
zombie shooter developed with PyGame (http://pygame.org) and Python (http://python.org).
It was created to test the functionatly of PyGame, and to play around with Python a bit. 

Feel free to use the code you find in the files, but please give a link back the project webpage.
The font.py file is not my work, but is part a font test, so don't use it without correct attribution.
